## Project 1: Hangman Game

Hi! Thank you for glancing at my first project.

My project is based around EA Games Dante's Inferno. Drawing on dark religious iconography, I hoped to give my version of Hangman a feeling of raised stakes since I decided to do without the more common drawing of a hanged man.

Here, you can find what I hope the project to look like when it is finished:

And here, you can find my thought process for the project, start to finish:
